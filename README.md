# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## Project 4 of Flutter Course

This is my fourth project of the Flutter course. The goal was to reinforce concepts learned in my previous projects and practice building interactive apps using Flutter widgets.

---

## My Goal

The objective of this challenge was to solidify what I learned in the Dicee tutorial. This app guided me through the steps required to build an 8 ball app and I applied what I learned about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.

## What I Created

I made a magical 8 ball app that gives answers to all the tricky questions in life. You can make the ball change at the press of a button.

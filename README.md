# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## Project 4 of Flutter Course

This is my fourth project of the Flutter course. The goal was to reinforce concepts learned in my previous projects and practice building interactive apps using Flutter widgets.

---

## About the Project

Magic 8 Ball is a fun and interactive Flutter app that simulates the classic Magic 8 Ball toy. Ask any question, tap the ball, and get a random answer! This project helped me practice state management, asset handling, and UI design in Flutter.

### Key Features
- Tap the ball to get a random answer
- Uses images for different ball states
- Simple and clean UI
- Responsive design for different devices

## My Goal

The objective of this challenge was to solidify what I learned in the Dicee tutorial. This app guided me through the steps required to build an 8 ball app and I applied what I learned about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.

## What I Created

I made a magical 8 ball app that gives answers to all the tricky questions in life. You can make the ball change at the press of a button.

## What I Learned
- How to use Stateless and Stateful widgets in Flutter
- Managing app state and updating the UI
- Handling assets (images) in a Flutter project
- Structuring a Flutter app for clarity and maintainability
- Using randomization in Dart
